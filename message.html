            Dear Adriana,
        </p>
        <p class="lh-base">
            Today is our first monthsary, and it’s hard to believe how quickly time has flown since you came into my life. I just wish we could be together today—to hold you close and celebrate this day side by side. Not being able to see you makes me miss you so much, but even from afar, I’m grateful for every moment we share.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-base">
            You mean the world to me, Adi. Every day with you, I feel incredibly lucky to have found someone who loves me as deeply as you do. Even though we've had our ups and downs, please know that I’d rather keep suyuin ka again and again than even consider being with someone else. I’m sorry for any of my shortcomings, baby, for the times I overthink, and if I’m a bit clingy at times. I just love you so much, and I can't help but want to be close to you.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-base">
            I’m sorry if I can’t take you out to fancy places, and if I can't always buy you everything you crave. I know it’s always just the simple things—fried rice, longanisa, hotdogs, sardinas, french fries, and sometimes, sorry baby, nasusunog ko pa—but one day, I promise, we’ll have everything. Once we’re both successful, I'll be able to give you all the things you deserve. Until then, I’m giving you everything I have: my loyalty, my commitment, and my heart. I promise to love you faithfully, deeply, and completely until my last day.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-base">
            I love you, Ms. Adriana Lian A. Andres, more than words can say. Thank you for being mine. Happy first monthsary, baby! ❤️
        </p>
        <p class="lh-base">
            Forever yours,<br>
            Jaren Quegan
